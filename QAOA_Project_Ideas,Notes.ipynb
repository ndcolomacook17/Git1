    "# Questions\n",
    "1. Hardware vs. non-hardware native graphs\n",
    "    - Hardware native- problem topology matches the hardware topology, these are easier to solve as the logical info in each qubit is contained within that same qubit throughout\n",
    "    - Non-hardware native: require more overhead, specifically need to move/swap logical info between qubits -> must use swap networks\n",
    "    - How difficult is it to apply QAOA to these non-hardware native graphs?\n",
    "2. What does the convergence path for ($\\beta, \\gamma$) look like in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$\n",
    "    - Could we plot the convergence path $\\forall \\; (\\beta_{i}, \\gamma_{i})$ pairs $\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2p}$?\n",
    "    - You can plot ($\\beta, \\gamma$) space with a heat map where the 3rd axis is the normalized cost fxn $\\frac{<C>}{C_{min}}$, aka approximation ratio\n",
    "3. To compete with analog best classical algos, QAOA must go past low-depth (p=1) and we currently explore the range $p\\in[1,10]$ \n",
    "    - But as $\\lim_{p\\to\\infty}$, optimization of the 2p parameters becomes __exponentially__ difficult if we pick RI (random initialization)"
